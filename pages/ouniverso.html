<h1>
    The Universe
</h1>

<p>
    The word Universe derives from the Latin universum. 
    The Latin word was used by Cicero and later by other authors with the same meaning it holds today.
    The Latin term originates from the poetic contraction unvorsum—first used by Lucretius in Book IV of 
    his On the Nature of Things—which combines un, uni (one) with vorsum, versum (meaning "something turned, rolled, or changed").
