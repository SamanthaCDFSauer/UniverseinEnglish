    <p>
        Celestial bodies and heavenly objects have always been a source of great fascination for humanity.
        There are records of Greeks, Mesopotamians, and Aztecs describing various celestial events.
        In the contemporary era, many scientists made significant contributions to turning the dream of 
        exploring space into reality, such as the Russian Konstantin Tsiolkovsky, the German Hermann Oberth, and the American Robert Goddard.
